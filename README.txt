This is the repository for a low-power, low-cost, field portable PCR device.

Inspired by OpenPCR.org, and the PersonalPCR (Templeman Automation), we are
making an open-hardware PCR system (extraction, thermocycler, read-out) for
field use in the developing world.

The work is based at the University of Notre Dame in the Biomedical Photonics
group, under the direction of Prof. Scott Howard (showard@nd.edu).
